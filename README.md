# Hello World! 👋
I am an unorthodox PoliSci researcher with a fondness for data science and a passion for putting scientific thinking at the centre of political theory and policymaking. 

Better yet, I am  fervent advocate for using innovative data collection technologies for improving research and having a greater impact. Besides my research and academic work, I'm also a habitual commentator on international political affairs for [the Loop: ECPR](https://theloop.ecpr.eu/) and [European Waves.](https://www.europeanwaves.com/)
